This website provides a free-to-use quality assurance process for spacecraft applications, with a focus on GNC, FSW, and astrodynamics quality assurances. Way too often, the quality assurance of GNC and FSW teams is limited, often because no one is assigned to [specific quality assurance roles](/summary/roles/).

The process outlined here removes the need for a dedicated QA role: most of the quality is assured through automated processes and supplemental QA is done by every engineer in the team. **This process is designed to not get in the way of engineers**: most reviews are asynchronous enabling engineers the pick up the next requirement to work on.

The intent is to clearly capture traceability throughout development, allowing an independent observer to discern how requirements are addressed during each development activity as well as when and why changes are introduced.

**If followed throughout, this policy provides an easily-understood, easily-audited development arc, tracing requirements through code, unit test, integration, and verification.**
<!-- An example of an open-source project that follows this QA is nyx-space/nyx. -->
