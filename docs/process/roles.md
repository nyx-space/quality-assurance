## Importance
Roles and responsibilities are crucial to any GNC or FSW process. If team members don't know what is expected of them, they cannot fulfill their responsibilities adequately.

Each team member must be assigned one of the following roles upon joining a project.

## Engineer
Engineers focused on design and implementation.

## Stakeholder
Parties who are impacted by the project, whether within the same organization or not. They provide input based on some specific understanding of the project objectives. 

## Lead
A team member, e.g. GNC Lead, responsible for sign-off on an accepted version of the product and for determining which standards apply to each project. The lead is an active participant in the development of the project. That person acts as a tie-breaker for engineering decisions. The Lead duly inspects verification and validation testing.

## Chief engineer
Party independent from the development process whose sole responsibility is tracing and documenting each step of the process to ensure that the project complies with QA policy at specific decision points. This role ensures independence in the QA.
