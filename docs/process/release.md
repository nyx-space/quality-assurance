The final step is for the Lead and the Chief Engineer to review that the process has been followed correctly and release this version. This stage may involve additional testing that could not have been conducted prior to this (e.g. hardware integration testing). If there was any rejection at the _lead review_ decision points, learned lessons must be captured as described below.

## Lessons learned

Supporting continuous improvement requires closed-loop capture of specific lessons learned by each member of the team. This is akin to the _retrospective_ of a SCRUM process. Any insight learned about a better way to do something is considered a lesson. Formally identifying and sharing these lessons has a long-term effect on the quality of the software. Lessons shall outline the problem encountered and the recommended solution.

## Versioning

Prior to a new release, all code development should be frozen and only bug fixes should be worked on. Along with a new software version, a new detailed design version shall be published, preferably with the same version number, cf. the [versioning guidelines](/guidelines/versioning/). The release notes should point to each revision of the documentation and the code.
